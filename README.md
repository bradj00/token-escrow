# token-escrow

Permissionless escrow service dapp to help two parties securely trade assets with no trust and no third party.

Contracts written in Solidity. Front end written in React.

This is also my first dApp designed with a mobile-first approach to UI/UX rather than desktop.


### New Escrow setup UI in progress
