# token-escrow

Permissionless escrow service dapp to help two parties securely trade assets with minimal trust and no third party.

Written in Solidity and mostly ReactJS.

This is also a dApp I am designing with a mobile-first approach to designing UI/UX rather than desktop. 


### New Escrow setup UI in progress
